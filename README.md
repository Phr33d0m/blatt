What is this?
=============
Just a very simple script to help Gentoo arch testers find out issues with packages' build systems.
It should find very obvious problems, but is far from perfect. Also, it could (and will probably do for sure) miss issues that is supposed to find out.


Bugs?
=====
All type of help is appreciated.
I'm a very newbie into Bash so, bug reports, new ideas and patches are ALWAYS welcome!
